# SVG-Logo-Maker

## User Story

As a developer
I want to create an application to generate a logo for projects
So that a logo can be easily created for free by answering the given prompts

## Description

When I run the application in the index.js file I am given an set of prompts to fill out so I can create my own customized logo. I am given a prompt to enter 1-3 characters. I am able to input a text color of my choice and a shape color of my choice. I am then given a prompt to select one shape out of 3 selections ( Cirle, Square, Triangle). Once I am finished filling out the prompts I am given a message in the console that my logo has been created and I will see a logo.svg file to view. I am able to open the logo file in my browser and view my new logo that corresponds with my input choices.
